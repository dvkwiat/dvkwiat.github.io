This is a blurb about me. Why do I enjoy economics? Where am I from? What are my fields of interest? Why do I enjoy teaching economics? 

This is a link to my [CV](https://dvkwiat.github.io/cv.md), as a separate page on the same site. Hopefully that page will also give you the opportunity to download my CV as a pdf.

There should be another link here, to a pdf of my job market paper. This paragraph should also include a heading ("Job market paper") and a brief abstract.

Research
======
This should include titles and brief blurbs about (1) my job market paper, (2) the working paper with Charlie and Sean, (3) my paper in progress with Sasha, (4) my work on voting games, (5) my work on Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) in the lab. There should be links to my job market paper and the paper with Charlie and Sean. And as many others as I can get to a presentable status.

Teaching
======
This section gives my teaching experience. I should mention teaching 2010 and 3010, as well as maybe core prep, and TAing 5090 and others all as a big list. I'll mention Marc as a point of contact.

Skills
======
Maybe I'll mention my coding here? But it might be unnecessary. Python, Matlab, STATA. zTree as well, although I guess that goes without saying for an experimentalist.


On a different note, how can I squeeze in a picture of me hiking somewhere?
