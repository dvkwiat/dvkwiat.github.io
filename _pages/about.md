I am a behavioral economist, using theory and lab experiments to explore information transmission topics such as price-quality inference. I enjoy teaching and searching for the perfect graph to communicate complex data. Outside of academia, I love spending time in nature with my wife and 3-year-old in Charlottesville, Virginia.

[CV](../files/cv.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [job market paper](../files/jmp.pdf)

Research
======
This should include titles and brief blurbs about (1) my job market paper, (2) the [working paper with Charlie and Sean](../files/paper3.pdf), (3) my paper in progress with Sasha, (4) my work on voting games, (5) my work on Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) in the lab. There should be links to my job market paper and the paper with Charlie and Sean. And as many others as I can get to a presentable status.

Teaching
======
This section gives my teaching experience. I should mention teaching 2010 and 3010, as well as maybe core prep, and TAing 5090 and others all as a big list. I'll mention Marc as a point of contact.

Skills
======
Maybe I'll mention my coding here? But it might be unnecessary. Python, Matlab, STATA. zTree as well, although I guess that goes without saying for an experimentalist.


On a different note, how can I squeeze in a picture of me hiking somewhere?
