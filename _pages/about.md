I am a behavioral economist, using theory and lab experiments to explore information transmission topics such as price-quality inference. I enjoy teaching and searching for the perfect graph to communicate complex data. Outside of academia, I love spending time in nature with my wife and 3-year-old in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Working Papers

* ["Competition and Price Informativeness: An Experiment"](../files/jmp.pdf)
  Consumers often rely on price as a guide to the quality of a product. If consumers are unable to observe quality directly, price might not perfectly communicate product quality. In this context, competition might increase or decrease the informativeness of prices. I study how competition impacts the informativeness of prices theoretically and in a lab experiment. While theory leaves the question open, I find in the experiment that competition leads both high- and low-quality firms to decrease prices, but the price reduction is larger for high-quality firms who are more likely to price high in the absence of competition. Thus, prices become a less reliable guide to quality when there are more sellers in the market.
* ["The Directional Difference Test"](../files/ddt.pdf) (joint with Charlie Holt and Sean Sullivan)
  When analyzing data from experiments involving more than two treatments that can be ranked in terms predicted effect, it is natural to turn to statistical tests with directional alternative hypotheses. This paper uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the power characteristics of the Directional Difference test, which has a test statistic defined as the sum of treatment differences for all pairs of sample observations in different treatments. When sample data are distributed according to familiar distributions like the normal, uniform, and logistic distributions, we find that the Directional Difference test is better able to detect treatment effects than the commonly used Jonckheere-Terpstra test. The Jonckheere-Terpstra test still performs best for heavy-tailed distributions. Experimenters wishing to exploit the informational content of multiple-treatment samples should consider replacing the Jonckheere-Terpstra test with the Directional Difference test in appropriate circumstances.
